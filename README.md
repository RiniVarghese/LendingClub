## General Information
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.
  When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks     are associated with the bank’s decision
  If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
